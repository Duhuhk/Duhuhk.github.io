      <p>You have encountered a wild human's (mostly incomplete) GitHub user site!<br/>Below are the projects I bothered making into websites.</p>
      <div>
         <a href="https://duhuhk.github.io/calculatingpi/">Calculating pi</a> <br />
         <i>Uses area, proportion, and a theoretically infinite amount of virtual darts to calculate the value of pi.</i>
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
         <a href="https://duhuhk.github.io/cocjp/">COCJP</a> <br />
         <i>A website for compiling, collaborating on, and sharing notes taken in introductory Japanese language courses.</i>
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
         <a href="https://duhuhk.github.io/3dincontext2d/">3D renderer</a> <br />
         <i>A page with two links, each for an attempt of mine at making a 3D renderer entirely in JavaScript's context-2d canvas.</i>    <br />
         <i>The first, 'legacy', was my initial attempt at making a 3D renderer. It's admittedly pretty bad.</i>                          <br />
         <i>The second, 'volumes of revolution', is taken from my AP Calc BC final project. It takes up to two equations and revolves them around the x-axis to be viewed in 3D space.</i>
